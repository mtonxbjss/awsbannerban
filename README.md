# AWS BANNER BAN

A browser extension designed for Firefox.

Annoyed by those blue flash banners that overlay the content in several AWS console pages? Me too!

AWS Banner Ban automatically removes the banners from the console so you can focus on adding real value. 

**AWS Banner Ban removes**:
- Survey requests
- Information about recent console or service changes
- "Welcome" popover dialogs that appear whenever you log into a new AWS account
- and more!

**AWS Banner Ban does NOT remove**:
- Error messages (red banners)
- Notifications of successful operations (green banners)


## Features

Just turn it on and let it go! Click the toolbar button to enable/disable banning of all in-scope banners. 

The toolbar icon will update to show when banners have been banished.
